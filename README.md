# Using React, Redux and React-router
- An application where people can rate their favourite Star Wars characters (to get the list we will use the Star Wars API https://swapi.co/api/people/?page=1)
- The app will consist of a list view of characters, and a single view for character detail.

- Each character component will allow you to up-vote or down-vote that character, it will display the votes that character has received and the overall percentage of votes compared against the total votes.

- Users will have filtering options they will be able to filter by the character’s name in a search box. (such as 'darth' will show only characters with darth in the name).

- These characters will be ordered by the popularity of their votes and will show the character’s name, and planet of their origin (and optionally provide a picture for the character).

- Users will be able to click on a character and see a detail view of that character which will display all of the detail provided for that character.

- In the detail view, users will be able to write a simple comment which will be displayed only in the detail view.
